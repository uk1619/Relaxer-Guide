# Relaxer-Guide
Relaxer Guide is a minimalist breathing app designed to help users practice mindful breathing and relaxation techniques. With a simple yet effective visual guide, it assists users in regulating their breathing patterns by indicating when to breathe in, hold, and breathe out.

🌀 Features
Visual Breathing Guide:
A gradient circle that grows, pauses, and shrinks to mimic the rhythm of mindful breathing.
Pointer Animation:
A small circle pointer moves dynamically to indicate the breathing phase.
Smooth Animations:
CSS animations for the grow/shrink effects, offering a visually calming experience.
Breathing Logic:
JavaScript-powered timing ensures accurate synchronization of animations with breathing phases.
🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure of the app.
CSS: Powers the design and animations, including the gradient circle and pointer movement.
JavaScript: Implements the breathing cycle logic for an interactive experience.
📖 How It Works
The gradient circle grows to represent breathing in.
It pauses briefly for the hold phase.
It shrinks to guide the breathe-out phase.
A pointer moves dynamically around the circle to further assist with timing.
