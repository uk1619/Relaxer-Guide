# Relaxer Guide  

**Relaxer Guide** is a minimalist breathing app designed to help users practice mindful breathing and relaxation techniques. With a simple yet effective visual guide, it assists users in regulating their breathing patterns by indicating when to breathe in, hold, and breathe out.

## 🌀 Features  

- **Visual Breathing Guide**:  
  A gradient circle that grows, pauses, and shrinks to mimic the rhythm of mindful breathing.  
- **Pointer Animation**:  
  A small circle pointer moves dynamically to indicate the breathing phase.  
- **Smooth Animations**:  
  CSS animations for the grow/shrink effects, offering a visually calming experience.  
- **Breathing Logic**:  
  JavaScript-powered timing ensures accurate synchronization of animations with breathing phases.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the app.  
- **CSS**: Powers the design and animations, including the gradient circle and pointer movement.  
- **JavaScript**: Implements the breathing cycle logic for an interactive experience.

## 📖 How It Works  

1. The gradient circle grows to represent **breathing in**.  
2. It pauses briefly for the **hold** phase.  
3. It shrinks to guide the **breathe-out** phase.  
4. A pointer moves dynamically around the circle to further assist with timing.
